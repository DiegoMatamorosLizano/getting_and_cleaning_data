Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project

This repository contains files and information related to an extraction and cleaning exercise for a data set related to behaviour of smartphones users.

Context of the data (taken from README file added to the downloadable files in https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip):
"The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz...
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. "

As part of the files included in this repository, there is file name run_analysis.R which contains the steps performed to extract, clean and summarize the data; CodeBook with the description of the variables and the transformations made; and finally, the resulting data.
